libsm
=====

A library to support secure monitor mode implemented by ARM v7 Security
extensions.

API:

sm_init() - Initialize secure monitor mode
sm_sched_secure() - Switch to Secure OS
sm_sched_nonsecure() - Switch to Nonsecure OS

Usage:

- Call sm_init() at some point during Secure OS initialization.

- Provide a table in smcall_table.h accessible from global include path.

  The table contains DEF_SMCALL() macros specifying various attributes of an
  SMC call handler. See smcall.c for more details.

- Provide implementations for call handlers defined in the above step.

  [All handlers execute in monitor mode with interrupts turned off]

- When the Secure OS is done initializing, libsm automatically returns to the
  bootloader in the Non-secure world context.

- If an SMC handler needs secure OS services, call sm_sched_secure() to context
  switch out into the secure OS kernel with interrupts enabled.

- If an NS IRQ occurs during Secure OS execution invoke
  sm_sched_nonsecure() directly from the IRQ handler with a special return code.

Note that this library provides an implementation for the weak symbol
"platform_reset". It also assumes that r0 contains the size of memory reserved
for the secure OS.
